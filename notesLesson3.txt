using github will allow me to show my code to a much 
wider audience.

you'd want to push changes manually to Git, rather 
than it being automatic so that once you finish something
concrete, then its on git

fork is when you want to clone someone's repositry into
your own git account while still acknowledging the 
author
clone is when you copy someone's repositry directly to
your local drive
branches are used to add in new ideas without affecting
the code that is currently in production

local copies of local branches: by copying the last known
state of the remote stored locally we can fix merge 
conflicts between the github latest commit and the local 
latest commit before updating github 

Wihout git, collaboration would be easier in terms of
learning all the ways to merge, commit, add etc but
collab would be harder in doing things remotely, since
everyone would need to be in close collaboration, 
i.e int he same room or team all the time while working
