command is: diff -u f1.txt f2.txt
Using the command diff to locate changes in files 
is perfect, because it saves us from manually 
searching the files to find the difference

If one is to make mistakes or get errors they cannot
find the solutions to, by accessing previous versions,
they are able to find the differences, one of which 
must be causing the error in the first place

command: git log --stat
shows the different commits made on the files with id
numbers and the descriptions of the changes made in
the commits. the --stat option shows number of additions
and deletions too

command: git diff id1 id2
shows the differences in the two commits

its best to perform a single commit for every logical 
change rather than performing a commit every N hours
so that changes in the code can easily be tracked and
bugs can be identified more easily and each commit will
also make sense and run successfully

a repositry is a group of files that are committed together
every time because all of them are important in making
the program work

command: git clone link
this downloads the entire repositry, so files plus 
history of a project behind the link

command: git checkout id
we cna revert back to a previous commit with id 

by using git, we can easily mkae changes in a big program,
safe in the knowledge that if something goes wrong, we will 
have a old version that definitely works
